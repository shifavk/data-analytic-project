# data-analytic-project

* This project analyzes a movie dataset to understand what drives success:

Director impact: Does a star director guarantee box-office hits?

Genre impact: Which genres balance critical acclaim (IMDB rating) and commercial success (revenue)?

* Goal: Provide data-driven recommendations for the next decade of movie releases.

* Dataset & Prep

Features: Title, Genre, Director, IMDB Rating, Gross Revenue

Multi-genre movies were exploded for analysis

Genres with fewer than 10 movies were removed

* Key Insights

Director alone ≠ revenue: Star directors improve quality but don’t always boost box-office revenue.

* Genre drives success:

High revenue: Action, Adventure

High ratings: Drama, Mystery

Balanced: Comedy, Thriller, Sci-Fi

Strategy: Pair directors with genres that suit their track record and mix blockbusters, prestige, and balanced films.

* Technologies

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook / Colab

* How to Run
